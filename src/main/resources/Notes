1. Create nodes independently, and then link them with a separate action e.g. Bookmark Node and then resolve the references once 
   the child nodes have been processed. 
2. Certain nodes have to be filtered out e.g.:
   - Nodes with <Figure> tag:
     <Figure>
		<ImageData src="images/Annual Report Disney 2013_img_0.jpg"/>
	 </Figure>
	 <Figure>
		<ImageData src="images/Annual Report Disney 2013_img_3.jpg"/>
		<Caption>
			<P>Robert A. Iger Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Walt Disney Company </P>
		</Caption>
	 </Figure>
   - 
   
3. Tags to be investigated. <Part>, <Sect>, <L>, 

4. There are free flowing <P> tags and there are <P> tags within another tag.  

Data Model:
1. Next relationship between child nodes on the same level.
2. Need to keep track of the paragraph and sentence numbers globally.
3.
