<P>Chevron delivered solid financial and operating results in 2013 while advancing our industry-leading queue of major capital projects. Our sound financial performance was reflected in net income of $21.4 billion on sales and other operating revenues of $220 billion. We achieved a competitive </P>

<Sect>
<H4>13.5 percent return on capital employed. And for the 26th consecutive year, we increased our annual dividend payout to stockholders. Our total stockholder returns of just under 15 percent over the past five- and 10-year periods continue to lead our peer group. </H4>

<P>Throughout 2013 our major businesses generated strong operating results. In the upstream, we ranked No. 1 in earnings per barrel relative to our peers for the fourth continuous year. We began production at the Angola liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and achieved first oil from the Papa Terra project offshore Brazil. In 2013 we also advanced our two world class LNG projects in Western Australia. Construction at Gorgon is approximately 75 percent complete, and construction at Wheatstone is approximately 25 percent complete. Over the next four years we anticipate 15 project startups with a Chevron investment of more than $1 billion each, including two key deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot, which are expected to come online in 2014 and 2015, respectively. </P>

<P>We continued to add resources to our portfolio through both exploration and targeted acquisitions in 2013. The success rate of our exploration wells was nearly 59 percent, and we added crude oil and natural gas resources through discoveries in 10 countries. We grew our portfolio of opportunities with a new operating interest in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, new acreage in the Bight Basin offshore South Australia, and finalized agreements to pursue unconventional resources in Argentina as well as assume full operatorship of the Kitimat LNG plant and Pacific Trail Pipeline in Canada. We also successfully completed the first phase of our Duvernay Shale program in Canada. We added approximately 800 million barrels of net oil equivalent proved reserves, replacing almost 85 percent of production in 2013. The company’s three-year average reserve replacement ratio is 123 percent of net oil equivalent production. </P>

We anticipate that 2014 will be the peak year for spending on our Australian LNG projects as we move them closer to ﬁrst production. Overall, our long term production growth outlook is compelling, and we are investing today in projects that will deliver production, cash ﬂow and earnings growth to the end of the decade. Chevron’s business success is deeply linked to society’s progress. We partner with governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to build beneﬁcial and enduring relationships, manage the impacts of our operations, are committed to our vision of being  global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. We remain focused on ﬁnding and producing the affordable, reliable energy that drives global economic growth and human prosperity. And due to our unparalleled project portfolio and proven business strategies, I am conﬁdent that we are strongly positioned to contribute to these aspirations, as well as create enduring value for our stockholders.

In downstream and chemicals, we continued to beneﬁt from the investments we have made in our reﬁning system and from our competitive position in additives, petrochemicals and lubricants. In 2013 we ranked No. 2 in earnings per barrel relative to our peer group. And we neared completion on the construction of our Pascagoula Base Oil Plant, which will position us as the world’s leading supplier of premium base oil when it starts up in 2014. We also reached ﬁnal investment decision on Chevron Phillips Chemical Company’s (CPChem) U.S. Gulf Coast ethylene cracker and derivatives unit. These projects allow CPChem to take </Figure>

</H3>

<P>Energy Terms </P>

<P>Additives Specialty chemicals incorporated into fuels and lubricants that enhance the performance of the finished products. </P>

<P>Barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) A unit of measure to quantify crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas amounts using the same basis. Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content. See oil-equivalent gas and production. </P>

<P>Biofuel Any fuel that is derived from biomass — recently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts — from sources such as farming, forestry, and biodegradable industrial and municipal waste. See renewables. </P>

<P>Condensate Hydrocarbons that are in a gaseous state at reservoir conditions but condense into liquid as they travel up the wellbore and reach surface conditions. </P>

<P>Development Drilling, construction and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. </P>

<P>Enhanced recovery Techniques used to increase or prolong production from crude oil and natural gas fields. </P>

<P>Exploration Searching for crude oil and/or natural gas by utilizing geologic and topographical studies, geophysical and seismic surveys, and drilling of wells. </P>

<P>Gas-to-liquids (GTL) A process that converts natural gas into high-quality liquid transportation fuels and other products. </P>

<P>Greenhouse gases Gases that trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere (e.g., water vapor, ozone, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride). </P>

<P>Integrated energy company A company engaged in all aspects of the energy industry, including exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas; refining, marketing and transporting crude oil, natural gas and refined products; manufacturing and distributing petrochemicals; and generating power. </P>

<P>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) Natural gas that is liquefied under extremely cold temperatures to facilitate storage or transportation in specially designed vessels. </P>

<P>Natural gas liquids (NGLs) Separated from natural gas, these include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline. </P>

<P>Oil-equivalent gas (OEG) The volume of natural gas needed to generate the equivalent amount of heat as a barrel of crude oil. Approximately 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of crude oil. </P>

<P>Oil sands Naturally occurring mixture of bitumen (a heavy, viscous form of crude oil), water, sand and clay. Using hydroprocessing technology, bitumen can be refined to yield synthetic oil. </P>

<P>Petrochemicals Compounds derived from petroleum. These include aromatics, which are used to make plastics, adhesives, synthetic fibers and household detergents; and olefins, which are used to make packaging, plastic pipes, tires, batteries, household detergents and synthetic motor oils. </P>

<P>Price effects on entitlement volumes The impact on Chevron’s share of net production and net proved reserves due to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices between periods. Under production-sharing and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements, price variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to the company. For example, at higher prices, fewer volumes are required for Chevron to recover its costs under certain production-sharing contracts. </P>

<P>Production Total production refers to all the crude oil (including synthetic oil), natural gas liquids and natural gas produced from a property. Net production is the company’s share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government’s agreed-upon share of production under a production-sharing contract. Liquids production refers to crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil volumes. Oil-equivalent production is the sum of the barrels of liquids and the oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See barrels of oil-equivalent and oil-equivalent gas. </P>

<P>Production-sharing contract (PSC) An agreement between a government and a contractor (generally an oil and gas company) whereby production is shared between the parties in a prearranged manner. The contractor typically incurs all exploration, development and production costs, which are subsequently recoverable out of an agreed-upon share of any future PSC production, referred to as cost recovery oil and/or gas. Any remaining production, referred to as profit oil and/or gas, is shared between the parties on an agreed-upon basis as stipulated in the PSC. The government also may retain a share of PSC production as a royalty payment, and the contractor typically owes income tax on its portion of the profit oil and/or gas. The contractor’s share of PSC oil and/ or gas production and reserves varies over time as it is dependent on prices, costs and specific PSC terms. </P>

<P>Renewables Energy resources that are not depleted when consumed or converted into other forms of energy (e.g., solar, geothermal, ocean and tide, wind, hydroelectric power, biofuels and hydrogen). </P>

<P>Reserves Crude oil and natural gas contained in underground rock formations called reservoirs and saleable hydrocarbons extracted from oil sands, shale, coalbeds and other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas. Net proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, and exclude royalties and interests owned by others. Estimates change as additional information becomes available. Oil-equivalent reserves are the sum of the liquids reserves and the oil-equivalent gas reserves. See barrels of oil-equivalent and oil-equivalent gas. The company discloses only net proved reserves in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should refer to proved reserves disclosures in Chevron’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>Resources Estimated quantities of oil and gas resources are recorded under Chevron’s 6P system, which is modeled after the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ Petroleum Resource Management System, and include quantities classified as proved, probable and possible reserves, plus those that remain contingent on commerciality. Unrisked resources, unrisked resource base and similar terms represent the arithmetic sum of the amounts recorded under each of these classifications. Recoverable resources, potentially recoverable volumes and other similar terms represent estimated remaining quantities that are expected to be ultimately recoverable and produced in the future, adjusted to reflect the relative uncertainty represented by the various classifications. These estimates may change significantly as development work provides additional information. At times, original oil in place and similar terms are used to describe total hydrocarbons contained in a reservoir without regard to the likelihood of their being produced. All of these measures are considered by management in making capital investment and operating decisions and may provide some indication to stockholders of the resource potential of oil and gas properties in which the company has an interest. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Shale gas Natural gas produced from shale rock formations where the gas was sourced from within the shale itself. Shale is very fine-grained rock, characterized by low porosity and extremely low permeability. Production of shale gas normally requires formation stimulation such as the use of hydraulic fracturing (pumping a fluid-sand mixture into the formation under high pressure) to help produce the gas. </P>

<P>Synthetic oil A marketable and transportable hydrocarbon liquid, resembling crude oil, that is produced by upgrading highly viscous or solid hydrocarbons, such as extra-heavy crude oil or oil sands. </P>

<P>Tight oil Liquid hydrocarbons produced from shale (also referred to as shale oil) and other rock formations with extremely low permeability. As with shale gas, production from tight oil reservoirs normally requires formation stimulation such as hydraulic fracturing. </P>

<H5>Litigation Reform Act of 1995 </H5>

<P>This Annual Report of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements relating to Chevron’s operations that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “believes,” “seeks,” “schedules,” “estimates,” “budgets,” “outlook” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. </P>

<P>Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; the company’s future acquisition or disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies. In addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. </P>

<P>Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 14 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended December 31, 2013. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H5>Business Environment and Outlook </H5>

<P>Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam. </P>

<P>Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year. </P>

<P>To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. </P>

<P>The company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the United States. From time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. Governments may attempt to do so in the future. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. Those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. </P>

<P>The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 14 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2013. Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. </P>

<P>The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. </P>

<P>Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows: </P>

<P>Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. </P>

<Sect>
<P>The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. External factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest. </P>

<P>2011 2012 2013 </P>

<P>The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $109 per barrel for the full-year 2013, compared to $112 in 2012. As of mid-February 2014, the Brent price was $109 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The WTI price averaged $98 per barrel for the full-year 2013, compared to $94 in 2012. As of mid-February 2014, the WTI price was $100 per barrel. WTI continued to trade at a discount to Brent in 2013 due to historically high inventories stemming from strong growth in domestic production and limitations on outbound pipeline capacity from the U.S. midcontinent. After narrowing during the first six months of 2013, the WTI discount slowly widened into the fourth quarter as seasonal refinery turnarounds contributed to surplus supply conditions for WTI, while Brent prices were supported by supply disruptions due to international events. </P>

<P>A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). During 2013, the differential between North American light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms due to growth in U.S. light sweet crude production in the midcontinent region and pipeline capacity constraints at Cushing. Outside of North America, the light-heavy crude differential narrowed modestly in 2013 as supply disruptions in key producing countries tightened light sweet crude markets and additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came online. </P>

<P>Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page 18 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.) </P>

<P>In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.70 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2013, compared with $2.71 during 2012. As of mid-February 2014, the Henry Hub spot price was $5.53 per </P>

<P>MCF. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in North America. </P>

<P>Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. In some locations, Chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. International natural gas realizations averaged $5.91 per MCF during 2013, compared with $5.99 per MCF during 2012. (See page 18 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) </P>

<P>The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2013 averaged 2.597 million barrels per day. About one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2013 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2013 or 2012. At their December 2013 meeting, members of OPEC supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since December 2008. </P>

<P>The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2014 will average approximately 2.610 million barrels per day, based on an average Brent price of $109 per barrel for the full-year 2013. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant majority of Chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the United States. </P>

<P>On November 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater Frade Field about 75 miles offshore Brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. The source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. On March 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. No evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to these seeps have emerged. A Brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. On October 1, 2013, the Court dismissed the two civil lawsuits and approved a settlement under which Chevron and its consortium partners agreed to spend approximately $43 million on social and environmental programs. On November 11, 2013, the Court announced that the settlement is final. The federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against Chevron and eleven Chevron employees. On February 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, and on appeal, the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations, specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authorities. The company is assessing its legal options. The company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. </P>

<P>Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets. </P>

<P>The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. </P>

<P>Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 14 through 16 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations. </P>

<LBody>upstream earnings of $4.0 billion in 2013 decreased $1.3 billion from 2012, primarily due to higher operating, depreciation and exploration expenses of $420 million, $350 million, and $190 million, respectively, and lower crude oil production of $170 million. Higher natural gas realizations of approximately $200 million were mostly offset by lower crude oil realizations of $170 million. </LBody>

<P>The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2013 was $93.46 per barrel, compared with $95.21 in 2012 and $97.51 in 2011. The average natural gas realization was $3.37 per thousand cubic feet in 2013, compared with $2.64 and $4.04 in 2012 and 2011, respectively. </P>

<P>Net oil-equivalent production in 2013 averaged 657,000 barrels per day, essentially unchanged from 2012 and down 3 percent from 2011. Between 2013 and 2012, new production in the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania and the Delaware Basin in New Mexico, along with the absence of weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, was largely offset by normal field declines. The decrease in production between 2012 and 2011 was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with Cook Inlet, Alaska, assets sold in 2011. Partially offsetting this decrease was a ramp-up of projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Marcellus Shale and improved operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2013 averaged 449,000 barrels per day, down 1 percent from 2012 and 3 percent from 2011. Net natural gas production averaged 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2013, up approximately 4 percent from 2012 and down about 3 percent from 2011.

<P>International upstream earnings were $16.8 billion in 2013 compared with $18.5 billion in 2012. The decrease was mainly due to the absence of 2012 gains of approximately $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia and $600 million on the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, lower crude oil prices of $500 million, and higher operating expenses of $400 million. Partially offsetting these effects were lower income tax expenses of $430 million. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by $559 million in 2013, compared with a decrease of $275 million a year earlier. </P>

<P>International upstream earnings were $18.5 billion in 2012 compared with $18.3 billion in 2011. The increase was mainly due to the gain of approximately $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in Australia, higher natural gas realizations of about $610 million and the nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project. Mostly offsetting these effects were lower crude oil volumes of $1.3 billion and higher exploration expenses of $430 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $275 million in 2012, compared with an increase of $211 million a year earlier. </P>

<P>The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2013 was $100.26 per barrel, compared with $101.88 in 2012 and $101.53 in 2011.

<P>International net oil-equivalent production of 1.94 million barrels per day in 2013 decreased 1 percent from 2012 and decreased 3 percent from 2011. Project ramp-ups in Nigeria and Angola in 2013 were more than offset by normal field declines. The decline between 2012 and 2011 was a result of new production in Thailand and Nigeria in 2012 being more than offset by normal field declines, the shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil and a major planned turnaround at Tengizchevroil. </P>

<P>The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.3 million barrels per day in 2013, a decrease of approximately 2 percent from 2012 and a decrease of approximately 7 percent from 2011. International net natural gas production of 3.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2013 was up 2 percent from 2012 and up 8 percent from 2011. </P>

<P>Effective income tax rates were 40 percent in 2013, 43 percent in 2012 and 43 percent in 2011. The decrease in the effective tax rate between 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. The lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income and is generally recorded net of income taxes) and foreign currency remeasurement impacts. </P>

<P>The rate was unchanged between 2012 and 2011. The impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations was offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods. For international upstream, the lower effective tax rates in the 2012 period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales, one-time tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes, which were partially offset by a lower utilization of tax credits during the year. </P>

<P>Cash, Cash Equivalents, Time Deposits and Marketable Securities Total balances were $16.5 billion and $21.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $35.0 billion, compared with $38.8 billion in 2012 and $41.1 billion in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $1.1 billion in 2013, $2.8 billion in 2012, and $3.5 billion in 2011. </P>

<P>Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects. </P>

<P>Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $7.5 billion in 2013, $6.8 billion in 2012 and $6.1 billion in 2011. In April 2013, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.1 percent to $1.00 per common share. </P>

<P>Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Total debt and capital lease obligations were $20.4 billion at December 31, 2013, up from $12.2 billion at year-end 2012. </P>

<P>The $8.2 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2013 included a $6 billion bond issuance in June 2013, timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $8.4 billion at December 31, 2013, compared with $6.0 billion at year-end 2012. Of these amounts, $8.0 billion and $5.9 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end 2013, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2014, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. </P>

<P>Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. </P>

<P>The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor’s Corporation and Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard &amp; Poor’s and P-l by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. </P>

<P>The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. The company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings. </P>

<P>Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt, beginning on page 53. </P>

<P>Common Stock Repurchase Program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. During 2013, the company purchased 41.6 million common shares for $5.0 billion. From the inception of the program through 2013, the company had purchased 139.3 million shares for $15.0 billion. </P>

<P>Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Total expenditures for 2013 were $41.9 billion, including $2.7 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2012 and 2011, expenditures were $34.2 billion and $29.1 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. </P>

<P>Expenditures for 2013 include approximately $4 billion for major resource acquisitions in Argentina, Australia, the Permian Basin and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, along with additional acreage in the Duvernay Shale and interests in the Kitimat LNG Project in Canada. In addition, work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two Australian LNG projects and two deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. </P>

<P>Of the $41.9 billion of expenditures in 2013, 90 percent, or $37.9 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately 89 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2012 and 2011. International upstream accounted for 78 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2013, 72 percent in 2012 and 68 percent in 2011. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. in 2011. </P>

<P>Current Ratio – current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2013, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.1 billion. </P>

<P>Interest Coverage Ratio – income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2013 was lower than 2012 and 2011 due to lower income. </P>

<P>Debt Ratio – total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. The company’s debt ratio in 2013 was higher than 2012 and 2011 due to higher debt, partially offset by a higher stockholder’s equity balance. </P>

The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity,  drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2014 – $4.2 billion; 2015 – $4.5 billion; 2016 – $3.2 billion; 2017 – $2.6 billion; 2018 – $2.2 billion; 2019 and after – $6.9 billion.

<H5>Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk </H5>

<P>The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed on the next page. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the company’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_857">Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations </P>

<P>Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2013. </P>

<P>The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies, which have been approved by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. </P>

<P>Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2013 was not material to the company’s results of operations. </P>

<P>The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 95 percent confidence level as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. A one-day holding period is used on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations. </P>

<P>Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2013, the company had no interest rate swaps. </P>

<H5>Transactions With Related Parties </H5>

<P>Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page 46, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_858">The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues.

<P>For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. </P>

<H5>Environmental Matters </H5>

<P>Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union’s Emissions Trading System), national (such as the </P>

<P>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in Australia and New Zealand), and state or regional (such as California’s Global Warming Solutions Act) levels. </P>

<P>Most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position. </P>

<P>Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and  procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. </P>

<P>Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2013 at approximately $2.7 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $1.0 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. </P>

<P>For 2014, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.1 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. </P>

<H5>Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions </H5>

<P>Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. </P>

<P>The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure </P>
</Sect>

<P>Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations </P>

<P>guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: </P>

<Sect>
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</Sect>

<P>The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: </P>

<P>Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology and economic conditions. </P>

<P>The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: </P>

<Sect>
<P>1. Amortization - Proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unit-of-production (UOP) method. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a UOP basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2013, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&amp;A) for oil and gas properties was $11.6 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2013 were 4.8 billion </P>

<P>barrels. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the </P>

<P>UOP calculations for consolidated operations had </P>

<P>been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas proper</P>

<P>ties, UOP DD&amp;A in 2013 would have increased by </P>

<P>approximately $600 million. </P>

<P>2. Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. In assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined. Frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below. </P>
</Sect>

<P>Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page 73, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending December 31, 2013, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page 80 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 36, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. </P>

<P>Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. </P>

<P>Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 9 beginning on page 41 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” beginning on page 35. </P>

<Sect>
<P>No material individual impairments of PP&amp;E or Investments were recorded for the three years ending December 31, 2013. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&amp;E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired. </P>

<P>Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. </P>

<P>In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis. </P>

<P>From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values. </P>

<P>Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2013 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 24 on page 64 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. </P>

<P>Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 21, beginning on page 56, includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. </P>

<P>The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included beginning on page 56 in Note 21 under the relevant headings. Actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world’s financial markets. </P>

<P>For 2013, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent and a discount rate of 3.6 percent for </P>

<P>U.S. pension plans. For the 10 years ending December 31, 2013, actual asset returns averaged 6.4 percent for the plan. The actual return for 2013 was more than 7.5 percent and was associated with a continuing recovery in the financial markets during the year. Additionally, with the exception of two other years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent. </P>

<P>Total pension expense for 2013 was $1.3 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for 59 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2013 by approximately $85 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2013 by approximately $190 million. </P>

<P>The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2013, was a net liability of approximately $2.4 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2013, the company used a discount rate of </P>

<P>4.3 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase </P>
</Sect>

<P id="LinkTarget_859">Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations </P>

<P>in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary </P>

<P>U.S. pension plan, which accounted for 59 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $345 million, which would have increased the plan’s overfunded status from approximately $0.4 billion to $0.7 billion. </P>

<P>For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2013 was $218 million, and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2013, was $3.1 billion. For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>3.9</Lbl>

<LBody> percent discount rate to measure expense in 2013, and a </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4.7</Lbl>

<LBody> percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2013. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2013 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2013. For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to page 59 in Note 21 under the heading “Other Benefit Assumptions.” </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P>Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 58 in Note 21 for a description of the method used to amortize the $5.2 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2013, and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2014. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 61 in Note 21 under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” </P>

<P>Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. </P>

<P>Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 23 beginning on page 62. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. </P>

<P>Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting </P>

<P>The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>On May 14, 2013, COSO published an updated Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) and related illustrative documents.

<Sect>
<P id="LinkTarget_862">Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm </P>

<P>To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation: </P>

<P>In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. </P>

<P>A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; </P>

<P>(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>

<P>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>

<P>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </P>

<P>General Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant oils. </P>

<P>The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur. </P>

<P>Subsidiary and Afﬁliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the  issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity currently in income. </P>

<P>Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. </P>

<P>Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values. </P>

<P>Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. </P>

<P>Short-Term Investments All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.” Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as “Time deposits.” The balance of short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities” and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other comprehensive income.” </P>

<P>Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories generally are stated at average cost. </P>

<P>Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements </P>
</Sect>

<P>Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued </P>

<P>Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page 54, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. </P>

<P>Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the United States, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense. </P>

<P>Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9, beginning on page 40, relating to fair value measurements. </P>

<P>The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 24, on page 64, relating to AROs. </P>

<P>Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. </P>

<P>The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. </P>

<P>Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.” </P>

<P>Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. </P>

<P>Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. </P>

<P>Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. </P>

<P>Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company’s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 24, on page 64, for a discussion of the company’s AROs. </P>

<Sect>
<P id="LinkTarget_869">Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued </P>

<P>For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. </P>

<P>The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. </P>

<P>Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity afﬁliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and afﬁliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the  Consolidated Statement of Equity. </P>

<P>Revenue Recognition Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers </P>

<P>Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses </P>

<P>are generally recognized using the entitle ment method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page 30. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<Sect>
<H5>Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation </H5>

<P>The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis. </P>

<P>The “Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital” includes reductions of $79, $98 and $121 for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in “Net purchases of treasury shares.” “Other” includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities. </P>

<P>In February 2011, the company acquired Atlas Energy, Inc. (Atlas) for the aggregate purchase price of approximately $4,500. The purchase price included assumption of debt and certain payments noted below. The “Acquisition of Atlas Energy” reflects the $3,009 cash paid for all the common shares of Atlas. An “Advance to Atlas Energy” of $403 was made to facilitate the purchase of a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC on the day of closing. The “Repayments of long-term debt and other financing obligations” in 2011 includes $761 for repayment of Atlas debt and $271 for payoff of the Atlas revolving credit facility. The “Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital” includes $184 for payments made in connection with Atlas equity awards subsequent to the acquisition. The remaining impacts of the acquisition did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. </P>

<P>The “Net purchases of treasury shares” represents the cost of common shares acquired less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans. Purchases totaled $5,004, $5,004 and $4,262 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company purchased 41.6 million, 46.6 million and </P>

<P>42.3 million common shares for $5,000, $5,000 and $4,250 under its ongoing share repurchase program, respectively. </P>

<P>In 2013, 2012 and 2011, “Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments” generally consisted of restricted cash associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects that was invested in cash and short-term securities and reclassified from “Cash and cash equivalents” to “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company issued $374 in 2011 of tax exempt bonds as a source of funds for U.S. refinery projects, which is included in “Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.” </P>

<P>The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. The 2012 period excludes the effects of $800 of proceeds to be received in future periods for the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, of which $82 was received in 2013. “Capital expenditures” in the 2012 period excludes a $1,850 increase in “Properties, plant and equipment” related to an upstream asset exchange in Australia. Refer also to Note 24, on page 64, for a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>Fair Value Measurements </P>

<P>The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are described as follows: </P>

<Sect>
<P>Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded. </P>

<P>Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract. </P>

<P>Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<P>Note 9 Fair Value Measurements – Continued  </P>

<P>The tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. </P>

<P>Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>Derivatives The company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts, principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. </P>

<P>Properties, Plant and Equipment The company did not have any material long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2013 or 2012. </P>

<P>Investments and Advances The company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2013 or 2012. </P>

<P>Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents and bank time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $16,245 and $20,939 at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The instruments held in “Time deposits” are bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days, and had carrying/fair values of $8 and $708 at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,210 and $1,454 at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. At December 31, 2013, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to tax payments and certain upstream abandonment activities which are reported in “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of $11,960 and $6,086 at December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, had estimated fair values of $12,267 and $6,770, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $11,581 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of the other bonds is $686 and classified as Level 2. </P>

<P>The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2013 and 2012, were not material. </P>

<P>Financial and Derivative Instruments </P>

<P>Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. </P>

<P>The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. From time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. </P>

<P>The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. </P>

<P>The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. </P>

<P>Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows: </P>

<P>Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.” </P>

<P>Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. </P>

<P>The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufﬁcient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. </P>

<P>Operating Segments and Geographic Data </P>

<P>Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include mining operations, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies. </P>

<P>The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes “segment managers” who report to the company’s “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The CODM is the company’s Executive Committee (EXCOM), a committee of senior officers that includes the Chief Executive Officer, and EXCOM reports to the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation. </P>

<P>The operating segments represent components of the company, that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. </P>

<P>Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular contact with the company’s CODM to discuss the segment’s operating activities and financial performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major changes to the annual capital and </P>

<P>Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements </P>

<P>Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts </P>
</Sect>

<P>Note 11 Operating Segments and Geographic Data – Continued </P>

<P>exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all other matters connected with daily operations. Company officers who are members of the EXCOM also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the CODM. </P>

<P>The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States). </P>

<P>Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table: </P>

<P>Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of additives for fuels and lubricant oils and the transportation and trading of refined products, crude oil and natural gas liquids. </P>

<P>Descriptions of major afﬁliates, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows: </P>

<P>Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which was formed in 1993 to develop the  Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan over a 40-year period. At December 31, 2013, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $160 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. See Note 7, on page 40, for summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO. </P>

<P>Note 12 Investment and Advances – Continued </P>

<P>Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to operate the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. The project, located in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, has a 25-year contract term. Prior to the formation of Petropiar, Chevron had a 30 percent interest in the Hamaca project. At December 31, 2013, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately $170 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron’s underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. </P>

<P>Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company joined the consortium in 1997 and has investments and advances totaling $1,298, which includes long-term loans of $1,251 at year-end 2013. The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. </P>

<P>Petroboscan Chevron has a 39 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006 to operate the Boscan Field in Venezuela until 2026. Chevron previously operated the field under an operating service agreement. At December 31, 2013, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $180 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. In 2013, Chevron finalized a financial agreement with Petroboscan. The financing, not to exceed $2 billion, will occur in stages over a limited draw-down period set to expire on December 31, 2018. The loan will support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. The terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions. </P>

<P>Angola LNG Ltd. Chevron has a 36 percent interest in Angola LNG Ltd., which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. </P>

<P>GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products and petrochemicals, predominantly in South Korea. </P>

<P>Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by  Phillips 66. </P>

<P>Caltex Australia Ltd. Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Caltex Australia Ltd. (CAL). The remaining 50 percent of CAL is publicly owned. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of Chevron’s share of CAL common stock was approximately $2,400. </P>

<P>Other Information “Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $14,635, $17,356 and $20,164 with afﬁliated companies for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $7,063, $6,634 and $7,489 with afﬁliated companies for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. </P>

<P>“Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $1,328 and $1,207 due from afﬁliated companies at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $466 and $407 due to afﬁliated companies at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. </P>

<P>The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity afﬁliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron’s net loans to affiliates of $1,129, $1,494 and $957 at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. </P>

<P>Litigation </P>

<P>MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to ten pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. </P>

<P>Ecuador Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. </P>

<P>Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Tex-pet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s </P>

<P>In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineer’s report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineer’s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer’s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer’s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. </P>

<P>In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs’ submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer’s report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron’s prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron’s motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge’s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. </P>

<P>On February 14, 2011, the provincial court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The court rejected Chevron’s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs’ representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of “0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment.” The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panel’s decision to Ecuador’s National Court of Justice. As part of the appeal, Chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under Ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevron’s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court of Justice to hear the appeal. The provincial court appellate panel denied Chevron’s request for a suspension of the requirement that Chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the First and Second Interim Awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed on the next page. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court of Justice, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron’s cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio approved a court-appointed liquidator’s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100. On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment resulting in a judgment of $9,500. On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador’s highest court. </P>

<P>On July 2, 2013, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an embargo order in Ecuador ordering that any funds to be paid by the Government of Ecuador to Chevron to satisfy a $96 award issued in an unrelated action by an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law must be paid to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. The award was issued by the tribunal under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in an action filed in 2006 in connection with seven breach of contract cases that Texpet filed against the Government of Ecuador between 1991 and 1993. The Government of Ecuador has appealed the tribunal’s award. A Federal District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the tribunal’s award, and the Government of Ecuador has appealed the District Court’s decision. </P>

<P>Chevron has no assets in Ecuador, and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron’s operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision. On December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeals for Ontario affirmed the lower court’s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay, allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron has appealed the decision concerning jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on January 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for Ontario granted Chevron’s motion to stay the recognition and enforcement proceeding pending a decision on the admissibility of the Supreme Court appeal.  </P>

<P>On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary, Ingeniero Nortberto Priu, requiring shares of both companies to be “embargoed,” requiring third parties to withhold 40 percent of any payments due to Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and ordering banks to withhold 40 percent of the funds in Chevron Argentina S.R.L. bank accounts. On December 14th, 2012, the Argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the Freeze Order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. The court also clarified that the Freeze Order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron intends to vigorously defend against the proceeding. Chevron continues to believe the provincial court’s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador or any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the Ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. </P>

<P>Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador’s obligations under the United States–Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador’s obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Tribunal issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal converted the Order for Interim Measures into an Interim Award. Chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on January 4, 2012, and the Republic of Ecuador opposed Chevron’s application and requested that the existing Order for Interim Measures be vacated on January 9, 2012. On February 16, </P>

<P>2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the Republic of Ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron’s arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador “has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.” The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceedings into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on “collective” or “diffuse” rights arising from Texpet’s operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet’s operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. Chevron expects that the application of this ruling will be considered by the Tribunal in Phase Two, including a determination of whether the claims of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are individual or collective/diffuse. The Tribunal had set Phase Two to begin on January 20, 2014 to hear Chevron’s denial of justice claims, but on January 2, 2014, the Tribunal postponed Phase Two and held a procedural hearing on January 20-21, 2014. The Tribunal set a hearing on April 28-30, 2014 to address remaining issues relating to Phase One. It also set a hearing on April 20 to May 6, 2015 to address Phase Two issues. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, which will be the damages phase of the arbitration. </P>

<P>Through a series of U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On March 7, 2011, the Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending resolution of Chevron’s civil lawsuit by the Federal District Court. On May 31, 2011, the Federal District Court severed claims one through eight of Chevron’s complaint from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. On September 19, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on Chevron’s ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for November 14, 2011, and denied the defendants’ mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. The Second Circuit issued its opinion on January 26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of Chevron’s ninth claim for declaratory relief. On February 16, 2012, the Federal District Court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on October 18, 2012, the Federal District Court set a trial date of October 15, 2013. On March 22, 2013, Chevron settled its claims against Stratus Consulting, and on April 12, 2013 sworn declarations by representatives of Stratus Consulting were filed with the Court admitting their role and that of the plaintiff’s attorneys in drafting the environmental report of the mining engineer appointed by the provincial court in Lago Agrio. On September 26, 2013, the Second Circuit denied the defendant’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus to recuse the judge hearing the case and to collaterally estop Chevron from seeking a declaration that the Lago Agrio judgment was obtained through fraud and other unlawful conduct. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. Post-trial briefing has concluded, but no decision has been rendered by the Federal District Court as of the date of this report. </P>

<P>The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineer’s report on alleged damages and the September 2010 plaintiffs’ submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). </P>

<P>Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2013 increased by approximately $1,600 from year-end 2012. The increase was related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged between periods. </P>

<P>The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carry- forwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2013, the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $3,064 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,301 primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2014 through 2029. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $11,572 will expire between 2014 and 2023. </P>

<P>Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and afﬁliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $31,300 at December 31, 2013. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of 2013, deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. </P>

<P>Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. </P>

<P>The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included. </P>

<P>The increase in unrecognized tax benefits between December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2013 was primarily due to additions for refund claims to be filed with respect to prior years. </P>

<P>Approximately 71 percent of the $3,848 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. </P>

<P>Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2013. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2008, Nigeria – 2000, Angola – 2001, Saudi Arabia – 2009 and Kazakhstan – 2007. </P>

<P>The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. </P>

<P>The company completed its assessment of the potential impact of the August 2012 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that disallowed the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. The findings of this assessment did not result in a material impact on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. </P>

<P>On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2013, accruals of $215 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $293 as of year-end 2012. Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $(42), $145 and $(64) in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. </P>

<P>At December 31, 2013, the company had $8,000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in December 2016, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2013. </P>

<P>At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the company classified $8,000 and $5,900, respectively, of short-term debt as longterm. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. </P>

<P>Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells </P>

<P>The company continues to capitalize exploratory well cost after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. (Note that an entity is not required to complete the exploratory well as a producing well.) The accounting standards provide a number of indicators that can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project. The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2013: </P>

<P>Of the $2,604 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2013, $1,733 (22 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. The $871 balance is related to 29 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. </P>

<P>The projects for the $871 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $382 (six projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within three years; (b) $47 (two projects) </P>

<P>– development concept under review by government; (c) $384 (nine projects) – development alternatives under review; (d) $58 (twelve projects) – miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 51 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects. Approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next three years. </P>

<P>The $2,604 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2013, represents 191 exploratory wells in 51 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis: </P>

<P>Compensation expense for stock options for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $292 ($190 after tax), $283 ($184 after tax) and $265 ($172 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units and restricted stock units was $223 ($145 after tax), $177 ($115 after tax) and $214 ($139 after tax) for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

<P>Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2013, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2013, there was $259 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. </P>

<P>At January 1, 2013, the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to 2,827,757 shares. During 2013, 776,180 units were granted, 1,007,952 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 64,715 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2013, units outstanding were 2,531,270, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $312 measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various LTIP and former Unocal programs totaled approximately 2.9 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2013. A liability of $107 was recorded for these awards. </P>

<P>Employee Benefit Plans </P>

<P>The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives. </P>

<P>The company also sponsors other postretirement (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the company’s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. </P>

<P>The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. </P>

<P>Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans) When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as the original Unocal Plans. Unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to expire through early 2015. </P>

<P>The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: </P>

<Sect>
<P>Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. </P>

<P>For 2013, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 71 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In 2012 and 2011, the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.5 and 7.8 percent for this plan. </P>

<P>The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. </P>

<P>Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2013, the company used a 4.3 percent discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and 4.7 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates at the end of 2012 and 2011 were 3.6 and 3.9 percent and 3.8 and 4.0 percent for the U.S. pension plans and the main U.S. OPEB plans, respectively. </P>

<P>Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2013, for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.3 percent in 2014 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2012, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7.5 percent in 2013 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. In both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent. </P>

<P>Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs.

<P>The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. </P>

<P>The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 88 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. </P>

<P>For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Benefit Plan Investment Committee has established the following approved asset  allocation ranges: Equities 40–70 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20–60 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, and Other 0–5 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed regularly: Equities 40–60  percent, Fixed Income and Cash 25–50 percent and Real Estate 5–15 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have  established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. </P>

<P>The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations. </P>

<P>Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2013, the company contributed $819 and $375 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2014, the company expects contributions to be approximately $350 to its U.S. plan and $350 to its international plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. </P>

<P>The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $215 in 2014, compared with $205 paid in 2013. </P>

<P>Employee Savings Investment Plan Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). </P>

<P>Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company’s contributions to the plan, which are funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP), which is described in the section that follows. Total company matching  con- tributions to employee accounts within the ESIP were $303, $286 and $263 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This cost was reduced by the value of shares released from the LESOP totaling $140, $43 and $38 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The remaining amounts, totaling $163, $243 </P>

<P>Note 21 Employee Benefit Plans – Continued </P>

<P>and $225 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, represent open market purchases. </P>

<P>Employee Stock Ownership Plan Within the Chevron ESIP is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In 1989, Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial prefunding of the company’s future commitments to the ESIP. The debt associated with the LESOP was retired in 2013 and the remaining unallocated shares were distributed to ESIP participants during the year. </P>

<P>The company reports compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less dividends received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on LESOP debt was recorded as interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares were reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. All LESOP shares were considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. </P>

<P>Total expense (credits) for the LESOP were $5, $1 and $(1) in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The net expense (credit) for the respective years were composed of compensation expenses (credits) of $4, $(2) and $(5) and charges to interest expense for LESOP debt of $1, $3 and $4. </P>

<P>Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares, $38, $18 and $18 were used in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to service LESOP debt. The company also contributed $7 and $2 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, to satisfy LESOP debt service. No company contributions were required in 2011, as dividends received by the LESOP were  sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service. </P>

<P>Shares held in the LESOP were released and allocated to  the accounts of ESIP participants based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year and remaining debt service. LESOP shares as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, were as follows: </P>

<P>Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2013, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. </P>

<P>Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, trust assets of $40 and $48, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. </P>

<P>Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $871, $898 and $1,217 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, beginning on page 55. </P>

<P>At December 31, 2013, about 143 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron LTIP.

<P>Other Contingencies and Commitments </P>

<P>Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page 51, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As discussed on page 53, Chevron completed its assessment of the potential impact of the August 2012 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that disallowed the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. The findings of this assessment did not result in a </P>

<Sect>
<P>Note 23 Other Contingencies and Commitments – Continued </P>

<P>material impact on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. </P>

<P>Guarantees The company’s guarantee of $524 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 14-year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. </P>

<P>Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. </P>

<P>Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. </P>

<P>Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2014 – $4,200; 2015 – $4,500; 2016 – $3,200; 2017 – $2,600; 2018 </P>

<P>– $2,200; 2019 and after – $6,900. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $3,600 in 2013, $3,600 in 2012 and $6,600 in 2011. </P>

<P>Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. </P>

<P>Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical companies. </P>

<P>Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2013, was $1,456. Included in this balance were remediation activities at approximately 174 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The company’s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2013 was $179. The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. </P>

<P>Of the remaining year-end 2013 environmental reserves balance of $1,277, $834 related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. The remaining $443 was associated with various sites in international downstream $79, upstream $313 and other businesses $51. Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to </P>

<P>remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants. </P>

<P>The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2013 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. </P>

<P>It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. </P>

<P>Refer to Note 24 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations. </P>

<P>Other Contingencies On April 26, 2010, a California appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of Richmond, California, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at Chevron’s refinery in Richmond. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on March 3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside the project EIR and conditional use permits and enjoining Chevron from any further work. On May 23, 2011, the company filed an application with the City Planning Department for a conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant, certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure. On June 10, 2011, the City published its Notice of Preparation of the revised EIR for the project. The revised and recirculated EIR is intended to comply with the appeals court decision. Management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain. Due to the uncertainty of the company’s future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time. </P>

<P>Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods  to resolve. </P>

<P>The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods. </P>
</Sect>

<Sect>
<H4>Note 24 </H4>

<P>Asset Retirement Obligations </P>

<P>The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. </P>

<P>AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. </P>

<P>more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. He was chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, served on the United Nations Expert Group on Resources Classification, and is a past member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training and the California Conservation Committee. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and serves on the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. </P>

<P>All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The reserves activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to preserve corporate-level independence.   </P>

<P>The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Corporate Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. </P>

<P>During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. </P>

<P>RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Corporate Reserves Manual. </P>

<P>Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2013, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. </P>

<P>Proved Undeveloped Reserve Quantities At the end of 2013, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), a decrease of 56 million BOE from year-end 2012. The decrease was due to the transfer of 461 million BOE to proved developed, partially offset by increases of 210 BOE in extensions and discoveries, 7 million BOE in purchases, 42 million BOE in improved recovery and 146 million BOE in revisions. </P>

<P>Investment to Convert Proved Undeveloped to Proved Developed Reserves During 2013, investments totaling approximately $17.4 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $3.4 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Australia accounted for $9.6 billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. Expenditures of about $3.5 billion in the United States related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the midcontinent region. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled $3.0 billion, primarily related to development projects in Thailand, Indonesia and with the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Africa, another $2.9 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Proved Undeveloped Reserves for Five Years or More </P>
</Sect>

<P>Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Table V Reserve Quantity Information – Continued </P>

<P>At year-end 2013, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The reserves are held by consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. </P>

<P>In Africa, the majority of the approximately 300 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more is related to deepwater and natural gas developments in Nigeria. Major Nigerian deepwater development projects include Agbami, which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity, and the Usan development, which started production in 2012. Also in Nigeria, various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects are currently under development. </P>

<P>In Asia, less than 200 million BOE remain classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years. The majority relate to ongoing development activities in the Pattani Field in Thailand and the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields in Azerbaijan. </P>

<P>Affiliates account for 1.1 billion barrels of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion. In Venezuela, development drilling continues at Hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity. </P>

<P>Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. For 2013, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 44 percent and 46 percent. The consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period. </P>

<P>Proved Reserve Quantities At December 31, 2013, proved reserves for the company were 11.2 billion BOE. Approximately 18 percent of the total reserves were located in the United States. </P>

<P>Aside from the TCO affiliate’s Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the company’s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. About 18 other individual properties in the company’s portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the company’s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 44 percent of the company’s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. These properties were geographically dispersed, located in the United States, Canada, South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. </P>

<P>In the United States, total proved reserves at year-end 2013 were 2.0 billion BOE. California properties accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. reserves, with most classified as heavy oil. Because of heavy oil’s high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods, most of the company’s heavy oil fields in California employ a continuous steamflooding process. The Gulf of Mexico region contains 26 percent of the U.S. reserves and production operations are mostly offshore. Other U.S. areas represent the remaining 44 percent of U.S. reserves. For production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including water-flooding and CO2 injection. </P>

<P>For the three years ending December 31, 2013, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by, among other things, events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. </P>

<P>The company’s estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil and changes thereto for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are shown in the table on page 76. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 77. </P>

<P>Noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved reserve changes for 2011 through 2013 are discussed below: </P>

<P>Revisions In 2011, net revisions increased reserves 235 million barrels. For consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 63 million barrel increase in the United States. In Africa, improved field performance drove the 60 million barrel increase. In Asia, increases from improved reservoir performance were partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 32 million barrels, primarily due to geotechnical revisions. For affiliated companies, improved facility and reservoir performance was partially offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes at TCO. </P>

<P>In 2012, net revisions increased reserves 390 million barrels. Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects accounted for the majority of the 104 million barrel increase in the United States. In Asia, drilling results across numerous assets drove the 97 million barrel increase. Improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 66 million barrel increase in Africa. Improved plant efficiency for the TCO affiliate was responsible for a large portion of the 59 million barrel increase. </P>

<P>In 2013, net revisions increased reserves 354 million barrels. Improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 94 million barrel increase in Africa. In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in an 84 million barrel increase. Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins accounted for the majority of the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 40 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance. </P>

<P>Improved Recovery In 2011, improved recovery increased volumes by 58 million barrels. Reserves in Africa increased 48 million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery performance in Nigeria. </P>

<P>In 2012, improved recovery increased reserves by 77 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery performance in Africa and in Gulf of Mexico fields in the United States. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Table V Reserve Quantity Information – Continued </P>

<P>In 2013, improved recovery increased reserves by 57 million barrels due to numerous small projects, including expansions of existing projects in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. </P>

<P>Extensions and Discoveries In 2011, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 299 million barrels. In the United States, additions related to two Gulf of Mexico projects resulted in the majority of the 140 million barrel increase. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project increased liquid volumes 65 million barrels. Africa and Other Americas increased reserves 34 million and 30 million barrels, respectively, following the start of new projects in these areas. In Europe, a project in the United Kingdom increased reserves 26 million barrels. </P>

<P>Net Proved Reserves of Natural Gas </P>

<P>In 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 218 million barrels. In Other Americas, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 101 million barrels, primarily due to the initial booking of the Hebron project in Canada. In the United States, additions at several Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling activity in the mid-continent region were primarily responsible for the 77 million barrel increase. </P>

<P>In 2013, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 78 million barrels. In the United States, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 55 million barrel increase.  </P>

<P>Purchases In 2011, purchases increased worldwide liquid volumes 42 million barrels. The acquisition of additional acreage in Canada increased synthetic oil reserves 40 million barrels. </P>

<P>Table V Reserve Quantity Information – Continued </P>

<P>Noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas proved-reserve changes for 2011 through 2013 are discussed below: </P>

<P>Revisions In 2011, net revisions increased reserves 497 BCF. For consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 217 BCF increase in the United States. In Asia, a net increase of 196 BCF was driven by development drilling and improved field performance in Thailand, partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes in Kazakhstan. For affiliated companies, ongoing reservoir assessment resulted in the recognition of additional reserves related to the Angola LNG project. At TCO, improved facility and reservoir performance was more than offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes. </P>

<P>In 2012, net revisions increased reserves 1,855 BCF. A net increase of 1,007 BCF in Asia was primarily due to development drilling and additional compression in Bangladesh, and drilling results and improved field performance in Thailand. In Australia, updated reservoir data interpretation based on additional drilling at the Gorgon Project drove the 358 BCF increase. Drilling results from activities in the Marcellus Shale were responsible for the majority of the 318 BCF increase in the United States. </P>

<P>In 2013, net revisions increased reserves 718 BCF. A net increase of 627 BCF in Asia was primarily due to development drilling and improved field performance in Bangladesh and Thailand. In Australia, drilling performance drove the 229 BCF increase. The majority of the net decrease of 234 BCF in the United States was due to a change in development plans in the Appalachian region. </P>

<P>Extensions and Discoveries In 2011, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 4,680 BCF. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project accounted for the 4,035 BCF in additions. In Africa, the start of a new natural gas development project in Nigeria resulted in the 290 BCF increase. In the United States, development drilling accounted for the majority of the 287 BCF increase. </P>

<P>In 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves by 1,011 BCF. The increase of 747 BCF in Australia was primarily related to positive drilling results at the Gorgon Project. </P>

<P>In 2013, extensions and discoveries increased reserves by 1,021 BCF, with the majority in the Appalachian region in the U.S. </P>

<P>Purchases In 2011, purchases increased reserves 1,233 BCF. In the United States, acquisitions in the Marcellus Shale increased reserves 1,230 BCF. </P>

<P>Sales In 2011, sales decreased reserves 174 BCF. In Australia, the Wheatstone Project unitization and equity sales agreements reduced reserves 77 BCF. In the United States, sales in Alaska and other smaller fields reduced reserves 95 BCF. </P>

<P>In 2012, sales decreased reserves by 538 BCF. Sales of a portion of the company’s equity interest in the Wheatstone Project were responsible for the 439 BCF reserves reduction in Australia. </P>

<Sect>
<P>Table VI Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves </P>

<P>The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the FASB. Estimated future cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced. </P>

<P>The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the company’s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation prescribed by the FASB requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. </P>
