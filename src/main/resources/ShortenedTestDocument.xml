<P>Dear Shareholders, January 2014 </P>

<P>Looking back at everything we’ve accomplished this year, I am once again awed by the tremendous creativity and commitment of the men and women who make up The Walt Disney Company. As always, our thousands of cast members and employees around the world continued to go beyond the expected to achieve the extraordinary for our consumers, our guests, and our shareholders. And I can think of no better way to start this letter highlighting our success than by expressing my profound and continued appreciation for the people who made it possible. With such immense talent and dedication going for us, there really is no limit to what we can achieve. </P>

<P>In the last several years we’ve effectively integrated the major acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel and are well on the way to doing the same with Lucasfilm, creating an unprecedented and unparalleled collection of the world’s greatest brands and creative content, along with tremendous growth potential for the foreseeable future. We’ve also made a number of strategic investments to position the company to create even greater value and leveraged the strength of our entire portfolio of businesses to grow our presence around the world. In the process, The Walt Disney Company has been recognized as one of the world’s most reputable, admired and socially responsible companies by the likes of Forbes, Fortune, and Barron’s – applauded for our overall performance as well as the integrity with which we operate. </P>
